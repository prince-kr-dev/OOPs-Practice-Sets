# OOPs-Practice-Sets

1. **Class and Object**:  
   Write a class `Car` with properties like `brand`, `model`, and `year`. Add a member function to display the car's details. Create an object of `Car` and call the display function.
   
3. **Constructor and Destructor**:  
   Create a class `Student` with properties `name` and `age`. Add a parameterized constructor to initialize these properties, and a destructor that prints when an object is destroyed. Create and destroy a `Student` object to observe the output.
   
5. **Copy Constructor**:  
   Create a class `Book` with properties like `title` and `author`. Write a copy constructor to create a copy of a `Book` object. Test the copy constructor by creating a new object as a copy of an existing one.

4. **Encapsulation**:  
   Create a class `BankAccount` with private properties `accountNumber` and `balance`. Provide public methods to get the balance and to deposit and withdraw amounts, ensuring balance cannot go negative. Test it with different scenarios.

5. **Function Overloading**:  
   Write a class `MathOperations` with overloaded methods `add()`: one to add two integers, one to add three integers, and one to add two floating-point numbers. Test these functions by calling them with different argument counts and types.
